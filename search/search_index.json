We write here some help regarding the specific configuration needed for G-Obs API. A full documentation on Lizmap Web Client is available here: https://docs.lizmap.com/ Project # GeoPackage file # You can publish a Geopackage file alongside each G-Obs project, to be used by any software to display referential spatial layers on the map. To do so, just create and save in the appropriate folder a Geopackage file containing vector layers (and raster layers if needed) named as the QGIS project . For example, if your G-Obs project code is my_gobs_project , you must save the Geopackage file in the Lizmap data folder media/gobsapi/geopackage/my_gobs_project.gpkg . You can create and populate this Geopackage with the QGIS processing tool Package layers accessible with the Processing / Toolbox menu. Indicators # Documents # In the G-Obs database, you can add documents to illustrate each indicator. To do so, the table gobs.document must be filled with appropriate data. An indicator can have different types of documents: document : any document such as PDF, ODT, DOC, DOCX, ZIP file icon : the icon of the indicator (a simple and small image file). Must be a jpeg , jpg , png or gif . image : an image file (photo, illustration) other : any other unspecified type of document preview : the image to be shown as the main illustration of the indicator. Must be a jpeg , jpg , png or gif . video : a video file. url : a URL pointing to an external web page or document. All the document files must be stored in the API server. The document files must be stored inside a media/gobsapi/documents/ folder, with the media folder located in Lizmap repository root folder. This media folder must be writable. Do it for example with the following command: 1 2 chown -R :www-data /srv/data/media chmod 775 -R /srv/data/media For example, if Lizmap Web Client repository root folder is /srv/data/ , the root gobsapi media folder will be /srv/data/media/ and the documents must be stored in /srv/data/media/gobsapi/documents/INDICATOR_CODE/DOCUMENT_TYPE/DOCUMENT_FILE_NAME.EXT , where: INDICATOR_CODE is the code of the indicator, for example pluviometry DOCUMENT_TYPE is the type of the document, for example image DOCUMENT_FILE_NAME.EXT is the name of the file, for example a_picture.jpg Two examples: /srv/data/media/gobsapi/documents/pluviometry/image/a_picture.jpg /srv/data/media/gobsapi/documents/population/document/explaining_demography.pdf In the table gobs.document of the G-Obs database , the path must be stored relative to the folder /srv/data/media/gobsapi/documents , and must begin only with the code of the indicator. For example : pluviometry/image/a_picture.jpg population/document/explaining_demography.pdf The API module will then propose a URL to access each document, returned when querying the details of an indicator.
