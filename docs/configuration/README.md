# Configuration

The G-Obs **API module** is tightly linked to the **G-Obs QGIS plugin**, and to the use of Lizmap Web Client as the web map publication tool.

We write here some help regarding the specific configuration needed for G-Obs API. A full documentation on Lizmap Web Client is available here: https://docs.lizmap.com/

## Project

A project in G-Obs corresponds to a QGIS project published to Lizmap, with some specificities:

* **Indicators**: In the QGIS Project properties, you need to have a **project variable** `gobs_indicators` containing the list of indicators that you want to publish in the project. To do so, open the project properties (CTRL+MAJ+P), go to the `Variables` tab, and add a new variable: name `gobs_indicators` and value containing the list of indicator **codes** separated by comma. For example: `pluviometry,population` will "publish" these two indicators (pluviometry and population) with the QGIS project.
* **Connection name**: You must also add another QGIS **project variable** `gobs_connection_name` containing the name of the PostgreSQL connection name (as written in the QGIS connection configuration dialog). This connection name must be **exactly the same** as the name of the **PostgreSQL service** which is used locally (your computer) and in the **GobsAPI server**.
* **Additional spatial data**: you can also publish a **Geopackage file** alongside the project, to be used by any software to display referential spatial layers on the map with the observation data. To do so, just create and save a Geopackage file containing vector layers (and raster layers if needed) named as the QGIS project. For example, if you project file is `my_gobs_project.qgs`, you must save the Geopackage file in the same folder with the name `my_gobs_project.qgs.gpkg`. You can create and populate this Geopackage with the QGIS processing tool `Package layers` accessible with the **Processing / Toolbox** menu.

## Indicators

### Documents

In the G-Obs database, you can add documents to illustrate each indicator. To do so, the table `gobs.document` must be filled with appropriate data.

An indicator can have different types of documents:

* `document`: any document such as PDF, ODT, DOC, DOCX, ZIP file
* `icon`: the icon of the indicator (a simple and small image file). Must be a jpeg, jpg, png or gif.
* `image`: an image file (photo, illustration)
* `other`: any other unspecified type of document
* `preview`: the image to be shown as the main illustration of the indicator. Must be a jpeg, jpg, png or gif.
* `video`: a video file.
* `url`: an URL pointing to an external ressource

All the document files must be stored in the API server. The document files must stored inside a `media/gobsapi/documents/` folder, with the `media` folder located in Lizmap repository root folder. This `media` folder must be writable. Do it for example with

```bash
chown -R :www-data /srv/data/media
chmod 775 -R /srv/data/media
```

For example, if Lizmap Web Client repository root folder is `/srv/data/`, the root gobsapi media folder will be `/srv/data/media/` and the documents must be stored in `/srv/data/media/gobsapi/documents/INDICATOR_CODE/DOCUMENT_TYPE/DOCUMENT_FILE_NAME.EXT`, where

* `INDICATOR_CODE` is the code of the indicator, for example `pluviometry`
* `DOCUMENT_TYPE` is the type of the document, for example `image`
* `DOCUMENT_FILE_NAME.EXT` is the name of the file, for example `a_picture.jpg`

Two examples:

* `/srv/data/media/gobsapi/documents/pluviometry/image/a_picture.jpg`
* `/srv/data/media/gobsapi/documents/population/document/explaining_demography.pdf`

In the **table** `gobs.document` of the **G-Obs database** , the path must be stored **relative to the folder** `/srv/data/media/gobsapi/documents`, and must begin only with the code of the indicator. For example :

* `pluviometry/image/a_picture.jpg`
* `population/document/explaining_demography.pdf`

The API module will then propose an URL to acccess each document, returned when querying the details of an indicator.

## Observations

### Media

Each observation can have a photo, called media. When uploading this media file with the API entry point `/project/PROJECT_CODE/indicator/INDICATOR_CODE/observation/OBSERVATION_UID/uploadMedia`, the media file will be stored in the full path `/srv/data/media/gobsapi/observations/OBSERVATION_UID.EXT` where:

* `INDICATOR_CODE` is the code of the indicator, for example `pluviometry`
* `OBSERVATION_UID` is the UUID of the osbervation, for example `e8f0a46c-1d24-456a-925a-387740ade1c6`
* `EXT` is the extension of the original file sent, for example `jpeg`

which can build the example path: `/srv/data/media/gobsapi/observations/e8f0a46c-1d24-456a-925a-387740ade1c6.jpeg`
